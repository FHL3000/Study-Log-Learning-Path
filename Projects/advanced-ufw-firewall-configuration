# Advanced UFW Firewall Configuration Project

## **Objective**
This project focuses on configuring and enhancing the security of a network using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** on a Raspberry Pi. It serves as a practical demonstration of firewall management and advanced network security techniques.

---

## **Current Progress**
### **Enabled Ports**
1. **Port 22 (SSH)**: 
   - Configured to allow secure remote access.
   - Fail2Ban implemented to limit failed login attempts.

2. **Port 53 (DNS)**:
   - Enabled to support DNS traffic for Pi-hole.

3. **Fail2Ban Integration**:
   - Protects against brute force attacks by dynamically banning IPs after multiple failed SSH login attempts.

---

## **Planned Enhancements**
- Configure additional UFW rules:
  - Restrict specific IP ranges.
  - Add logging levels for better monitoring.
  - Create advanced rules for services like HTTP/HTTPS and ICMP.
- Test and validate all configurations for reliability.
- Document troubleshooting steps and resolutions.

## **Skills Demonstrated**
1. **Firewall Rule Management**:
   - Enabling and testing essential ports.
2. **Intrusion Prevention**:
   - Implementing Fail2Ban for SSH security.
3. **Security Optimization**:
   - Applying best practices for network protection.
